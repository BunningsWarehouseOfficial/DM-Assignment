use smote for oversampling the underepresenting
start pandas profiling
drop attributes that are highly correlated with each other, as they are redundant and may cause overfitting (>80%, >90%, >95%?)
attributes with very low correlations can probably be left alone

how much does any given attribute actually affect your performance (feature selection)
    drop random attributes and see if it improves the model or not

things to look into using
stratify()
sklearn grid search

normalization must be done before variance thresholding

[ ] write/draw a pipeline for processing, training, predicting, etc.
    with loop back arrows

for data prep steps with thresholds which are a bit ambiguous make the threshold variable a hyperparameter

input hyperparameter as command line arguments (unless you wanna do a hyperparameter grid search)

pca for reducing dimensionality
